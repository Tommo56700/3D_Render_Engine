CONTROLS
- Click and drag the mouse to rotate the object
- Use the mouse scroll to zoom in/out

HOW TO CHANGE MODELS/TEXTURES:
- At the moment file names are hard coded into the 'RunLoop' class
- You will have to edit line 39 to change the model file, and line 43 to change the texture file
- There are already some pre-exsisting .OBJ model files and .PNG texture files in the resources folder, use these or try your own
- New .OBJ files need to be made in the same format as the ones in currently in the resources folder (they must include surface normals)
